# TODO

* Formatting of type names (esp. generics!)
* Pasting of multi-line text
* Rendering of text during editing (things shift like crazy)
* Fix `cmd-\``, et al
* Update help text
* Fix logging to avoid duplication
* Make sure `Invoking` / `InvokingThread` are being managed correctly.
* Can we make output / logs show up inline so people don't need to switch to a console tab?
  * Alternatively, can we pop a window split vertically with our stuff at top, and a Console tab below?
